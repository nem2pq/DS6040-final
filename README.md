# DS6040-final
Final Project for DS 6040- Bayesian Machine Learning

## Running Code

The .ipynb file can be run in any location where jupyter or conda can be run (Google Colab, VS Code, etc.). Make sure to have all of packages listed at the top of the file downloaded and present in the runtime
The code should be runable by modifying the directory of the data file to where the provided dataset is located on your device. Running all cells in order should provide similar results (same results if same random seed is used).


## Two Code Versions
Additionally, we uploaded two versions of the code- one that includes output from our final run-through and one that does not. This is because the version that includes the output is a large file and cannot be previewed within the github interface, and must be downloaded in order to see output. This file is also over the github recommended file size limit of 50 mb. The smaller, no output file, is able to be previewed, and is present to act as a backup if any issues arise with the code with output.
