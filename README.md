# DS6040-final
Final Project for DS 6040- Bayesian Machine Learning

## Running Code

The .ipynb file can be run in any location where jupyter or conda can be run (Google Colab, VS Code, etc.). Make sure to have all of packages listed at the top of the file downloaded and present in the runtime
The code should be runable by modifying the directory of the data file to where the provided dataset is located on your device. Running all cells in order should provide similar results (same results if same random seed is used).
